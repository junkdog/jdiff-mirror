This is the main SP package for SuperProduct, also with extra
add-ons in the {@link com.acme.spextra.AddOns} class.

<!--
TODO link checked with linklint-2.3.5 -error -warn /@ and all is fine
in the example except for the link in the Javadoc text for
SuperProduct2.0/com/acme/sp/package.html. Looks like the old @link not
generating the correct href when it in a package bug?
